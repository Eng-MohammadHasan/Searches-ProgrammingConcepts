ðŸ”¹ C++ vector<T>

Dynamic array (contiguous block of memory).

If T is a normal type (e.g. int, struct Employee), the actual objects live directly inside that block.

Each index = the object itself (not a pointer).

If T is a pointer (e.g. vector<Employee*>), then the vector stores pointers, and those point elsewhere.

ðŸ‘‰ So: by default, no extra pointers. The data is stored in place inside the vectorâ€™s memory.


ðŸ”¹ Java ArrayList<T>

Dynamic array (contiguous block of memory).

But Java only works with references to objects (except primitives with autoboxing).

So the internal array holds references (pointers).

Each index = a pointer to an object on the heap.

ðŸ‘‰ Always pointers inside. Objects are never stored directly in the ArrayList.

âœ… Conclusion:

C++ vector â†’ dynamic array of actual objects (unless you explicitly store pointers).

Java ArrayList â†’ dynamic array of pointers to objects.
