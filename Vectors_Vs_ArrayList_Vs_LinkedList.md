## ðŸ”¹ Memory Layout


ðŸ”¹ C++ vector<T>

Dynamic array (contiguous block of memory).
If T is a normal type (e.g. int, struct Employee), the actual objects live directly inside that block.
Each index = the object itself (not a pointer).
If T is a pointer (e.g. vector<Employee*>), then the vector stores pointers, and those point elsewhere.

ðŸ‘‰ So: by default, no extra pointers. The data is stored in place inside the vectorâ€™s memory.


ðŸ”¹ Java ArrayList<T>

Dynamic array (contiguous block of memory).
But Java only works with references to objects (except primitives with autoboxing).
So the internal array holds references (pointers).
Each index = a pointer to an object on the heap.

ðŸ‘‰ Always pointers inside. Objects are never stored directly in the ArrayList.

ðŸ”¹Linked List

Elements (nodes) are scattered across memory.
Each node contains:
The data (object or value).
A pointer/reference to the next node.

No contiguous block â†’ each element lives anywhere in memory.
ðŸ‘‰ Access is sequential (must follow pointers node by node).

âœ… Conclusion:

Vector (C++): contiguous block, stores objects directly (fast direct access).
C++ vector â†’ dynamic array of actual objects (unless you explicitly store pointers).

ArrayList (Java): contiguous block, stores references (still fast direct access).
Java ArrayList â†’ dynamic array of pointers to objects.

Linked List: scattered nodes, each with pointer to next (no direct access).

## Indexing and Access

ðŸ”¹ C++ vector

Internally = contiguous array.
Access by index (v[i]) = O(1) (constant time).
No need to walk element by element â€” itâ€™s direct.

ðŸ”¹ Java ArrayList

Internally = contiguous array of references.
Access by index (list.get(i)) = O(1) too.
Again, no traversal like linked lists.

ðŸ”¹ Linked List (for contrast)

Elements are scattered in memory, each has a pointer to the next.
To reach index i, you must traverse node by node â†’ O(n).

âœ… Conclusion:
Both vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java give you fast direct indexing (O(1)), unlike linked lists.
