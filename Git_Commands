GIT CHEAT SHEET .... https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf

# Git & GitHub -->

1- Make changes to a specific project in terminal by ...
	
	{ cd .. path ... } 

2 - git init ...

3 - To get rid of the (.git) in your files  ... rmdir /s /q .git  

4 - To check which files are untracked or other things by 

	( git status ) 

5 - To add your files from your (working directory) to the
	
	( staging area ) , use 
	{git add --all , or individually , git add ..file name..}
 	
	finaly you can check (the added files & the untracked )
        by git status

6 - To commit your files to [local repository] , not your Remote ,
	not Github , we haven't set any of that up yet .
	This is all local ...
 
	(git commit -m "Your commit message")

7- But now for example if you ... fix something , or add feature ,
	make some changes ... whatever here you should 
	(add again)

8- (git log ) will show you your commits ...

9- Now time to [git push ] , push to a { Remote Repo },
	or Github , Gitlab ...etc .
	
	*Firstly ---> Create a new Repository in Github,
	
	*Secondly--- > there is a command given down below , 
	after creating the repository like this ...

	git remote add origin https:
	//github.com/E-MohammadHasan/task-tracker.git

	#This command will add our local repository as
	our remote repository !

	*Thirdly ---> Now we want to make sure that we're 
	in the main branch , {git branch -M main}
	
	*Finally ---> We want to push , use this
	 (git push -u origin main) only for the first 
	 time write (origin main) , but in the next pushs
	 just type ... ( git push ).

10 - If you would pull the changes from github
	 (remote repository) , and also we would do 
	this , if someone clone the repository and made 
	some changes and then push to it,  
	type {git pull}

11 - Sometimes you're gonna have some things in your project 
	that you aren't gonna want to push them to github ,
	so in this case , you're gonna create (.gitignore )
	file , and anything you will put it inside the file 
	will be safe but not pushed to the repository !
	put inside it the files name , that you want!

12 - [Shortcuts] , to {add and commit} at the same time , use 
	this command (git commit -am "..message..")
	and by git status you can see that there is nothing in 	
	the staging area , you will find (your branch is ahead by 
	1 commit) . Finally just type (git push ) , and see your 
	Remote Repository in github.

	#But for committing and adding for a specific file , 
	use this (git add index.html && git commit -m " Added task 7 ")
 	Then (git push).

13 - [Getting Code From GitHub] --->

	Downloading: You can download a zip of the repo
	git clone: Get a copy of the full repo on to your machine
	git pull: Get the latest changes from a repo
	git fetch: Get latest changes without merging
	forking: Copy a repository into your own account

14 - Clone by ...
	cd ---> Change directory in the terminal to the wanted path .
	copy https url and type 
	(git clone https.........)

	And by typing (dir) or (ls) in mac , you can know the files inside the path that you 
	change directory to it in the terminal ....
