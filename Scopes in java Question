public void pop() {
       //int x = -999999;
        if (isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("The stack is empty !");
        } else {
             int x = Array[top]; 
            top--;
        }
        System.out.println(x);
    }. why do we got an error here ????

Is this means that we store the value of x inside the block only like temporary not inside the memory ????????
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great question! Let's clarify what happens with variables in terms of scope, memory, and lifetime:

Scope and Lifetime of Variables
 
1- Scope:

When you declare a variable inside a block (like an if or else), the scope of that variable is limited to that block.
Once the program exits the block, the variable goes out of scope and cannot be accessed anymore.

2- Lifetime:

Variables declared inside a block are stored in memory (usually in the stack) while the block is being executed.
When the block finishes executing, the memory for that variable is released, and the variable is no longer available.
Temporary Storage in Memory
When you declare x inside the else block:

        java
        Copy code
        else {
            int x = Array[top]; 
            top--;
        }

The value of x is indeed stored in memory while the else block is executed.
However, after the block ends, the variable itself (and its memory) is destroyed because its scope was limited to the block.
So, the value of x is temporary, and it does not persist after the block finishes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
What Happens in Your Code
When System.out.println(x); is executed outside the if-else block, the variable x no longer exists in memory if it was declared inside the else block.
The compiler knows this and throws an error because you’re trying to access a variable that might not exist in all code paths.


# Key Takeaway
* Scope determines where a variable is accessible.
* Memory allocation for local variables only lasts as long as their block is executing.
* If you need a variable to persist beyond a block, declare it in a wider scope (e.g., at the method level).
This is why declaring x outside the block solves the problem—it ensures that x exists in memory throughout the method's execution.
