# Boxing and Unboxing in Java

## ðŸ”¹ Boxing

Boxing is the process of converting a primitive value into its corresponding wrapper object (`int` â†’ `Integer`, `double` â†’ `Double`, etc.).

### ðŸ”¸ Example:

```java
int a = 10;

// Boxing (primitive â†’ object)
Integer obj1 = a;                  // Autoboxing
Integer obj2 = Integer.valueOf(a); // Explicit boxing
```

## ðŸ”¹ Unboxing

Unboxing is the process of converting a wrapper object back into its corresponding primitive (Integer â†’ int, Double â†’ double, etc.).
### ðŸ”¸ Example:

```java
Integer obj = 20;

// Unboxing (object â†’ primitive)
int b = obj;            // Auto-unboxing
int c = obj.intValue(); // Explicit unboxing
```

#ðŸ”¹ When it Happens
##ðŸ”¸ Boxing

Boxing happens automatically when a primitive is stored in a place that expects an object â€” for example, adding a primitive to a generic collection like List<Integer>.
Example:

```java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(10); // int â†’ Integer (boxing happens here)
```

##ðŸ”¸ Unboxing

Unboxing happens when an object is used in a context that expects a primitive â€” such as in a loop, arithmetic operation, or conditional.
### Example:

```java
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(10, 20, 30);

for (int x : list) {   // Integer â†’ int (unboxing happens each iteration)
    System.out.println(x);
}

```

How & Avoids Copy

In C++, when you write:

for (Student s : students) { }


A copy of each element is made (constructor is called, data duplicated).

If you write:

for (Student &s : students) { }


s is a reference.

A reference is like a hidden pointer (but safer):

It points directly to the element in the container (vector/array).

No new object is created.

Access is just like using the original object.

ðŸ‘‰ So & means: "donâ€™t copy, just alias the existing element."
This is critical for big objects (e.g., classes with strings, data structures).
For primitives (int), the benefit is small but still avoids copy.

ðŸ”¹ Java Objects and References

In Java, all objects (Student, Car, etc.) are already stored as references inside arrays or collections (List<Student>).

When you write:

for (Student s : students) { }


Java just copies the reference (like copying a pointer in C++).

It does not duplicate the whole object.

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s why there is no & in Java â€” it would be redundant.
